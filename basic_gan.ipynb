    "\n",
    "1. **`transforms.Compose([...])`**  \n",
    "   This wraps multiple transformations into one. It applies them sequentially to the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`transforms.ToTensor()`**  \n",

    "3. **`transforms.Normalize(mean=(0.5,), std=(0.5,))`**  \n",
    "   Normalizes the tensor by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each channel. Here, the single value `(0.5,)` corresponds to one channel (like grayscale).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since the pixel values are between 0 and 1 after `ToTensor()`, normalization with mean=0.5 and std=0.5 converts them roughly to the range [-1, 1] using this formula:\n",

    "- **Normalize pixel intensity values** so the model trains more effectively (helps with convergence and stabilizes training by standardizing input).\n",
    "\n",
